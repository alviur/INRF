# Evidence for the intrinsically nonlinear nature of receptive fields in vision

This is the repository for the artificial neural networks experiments described in "Evidence for the intrinsically 
nonlinear nature of receptive fields in vision" paper (see citation).


# Dependencies
- Python 3.5.2
- Numpy 1.16.2
- Pytorch 1.0.0
 - [Adversarial-robustness-toolbox 1.2.0](https://github.com/Trusted-AI/adversarial-robustness-toolbox)

# Instructions 
1_INRFnets_classification: Contains a script for the accuracy on each reported dataset . A CNN version of each architecture is included as a commented-out section.
 
2_INRFnets_adversarial: Contains all the experiments on adversarial  attacks. Contains scripts to run a series of adversarial attacks over the CNN and INRF models trained in MNIST and CIFAR-10.
